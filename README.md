<h3>Known Issues / Bugs</h3>

After searching for a new city, you are unable to click any of the history items to search for the data.
The limit on search history items is uncapped, so it can get to a very long length and cause rendering problems.

<h3>What I Learned:</h3>

Creating my own CSS stylesheet made me think about the layout of the page when designing it.
jQuery allows for rapid development of your web application and simplifies what usually would take much more work using vanilla JS.
Breaking down any re-usable code into a function makes it more readable easier to code
Conclusion:
I need to keep improving my javascript scope knowledge as well as looking into JS best practices for improving my code.
I love jquery and will always use it.
